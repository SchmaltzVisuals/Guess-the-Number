The Guess-the-Number game is basically guessing a random number within the range 1-100. 
There are two game modes: easy/hard. 
Hard mode gives you 5 attempts to guess the number. 
Easy mode gives 10 attempts.

If you guess below the correct answer, the program will tell you to guess higher and vice versa if you guess above the correct answer.
